MangaReplicaApp

iOS version: 15,
Xcode: 13.X,
Language: SwiftUI

My first attempt to recreate a live service app from a scratch. 
This app uses JSON coadable data with classes Manga and Chapter with multiple view components.

There are three main view from Content: Home, Favorite, and Account.

Home view is where all the manga is listed and it shows you from the top: a weekday view, ads, recently viewed and more.

Favorite (bad naming it was supposed to be weekday list): shows user the list of all the manga filtered to their corresponding weekday updates.

Account: This shows user their most recenlty viewed and favorite manga.
