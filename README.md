MangaReplicaApp

My most recent app I built and released on the App Store. I created this app out of personal need. I have SO MANY random app ideas and wanted a place I could easily keep track of them. AppIdeasApp lets you create app ideas, brainstorm everything from name ideas, feature ideas, color schemes, and more. Less forgetting. More building. More shipping. I wanted to challenge my design skills on this project and had fun adding some animations (all with SwiftUI of course!)

I think you can link directly to the raw version of an image if it's stored in your repository. i.e.
