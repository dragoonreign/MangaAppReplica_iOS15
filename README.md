<h1>MangaReplicaApp</h1>

Total time spent: ~1 week

iOS version: 15,
Xcode: 13.X,
Language: SwiftUI

My first attempt to recreate a live service app from scratch. 
The app uses JSON-codable data for manga and chapter classes in multiple view components.

<h2>Showcase:</h2>

<h2> Details </h2>

There are three main view from Content: Home, Favorite, and Account.

<h2> Home </h2>

Home view is where all the manga is listed and it shows users different sections starting from the top: a weekday view, ads, recently viewed and more.
